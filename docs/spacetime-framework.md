# Spacetime Framework  
## The Structure of Emergent Geometry in the ESFE Model

This document describes the internal structure of spacetime as understood within the ESFE (Emergent Spacetime From Entanglement) theoretical framework. It expands on the conceptual foundations introduced in `theory-overview.md`, focusing on how geometry, locality, curvature, and motion arise from information-theoretic relationships.

# 1. The Informational Substrate

In ESFE, spacetime is not a continuous manifold or a classical backdrop.  
Instead, it emerges from an underlying network of quantum degrees of freedom.

This network can be thought of as:

- a graph of fundamental quantum states  
- a tensor network  
- or a quantum error–corrected structure  

Key features of the substrate:

- **Nodes** represent quantum states.  
- **Edges** represent entanglement relationships.  
- **Network connectivity** determines effective geometry.  
- **Information flow** determines causal structure.  

Spacetime is the *macroscopic appearance* of this informational structure.

# 2. Locality as an Emergent Property

In classical physics, two points being “close” means they have nearby coordinates.

In ESFE, “closeness” means:

> **Two regions share a high degree of entanglement.**

Thus:

- Locality is *not fundamental*  
- It is a *derived* property determined by entanglement density  
- Regions with strong entanglement appear adjacent in spacetime  
- Regions with weak entanglement appear far apart  

This concept is similar to holographic principles and tensor network geometry.

# 3. Curvature as Entanglement Gradients

In GR, curvature is determined by mass-energy.

In ESFE:

> **Curvature arises from spatial gradients in entanglement density.**

Examples:

- A smooth, uniform entanglement distribution → flat spacetime  
- A varying entanglement density → curved spacetime  
- Rapid entanglement changes → strong curvature effects  

This creates a geometric analogue:
